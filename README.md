# Simple smart wallclock thing

This is what the name says. I wanted to turn my old linux tablet into a smart wall clock, and I thought it sounded more fun to write my own script for it than use Magic Mirror.

Current plans are to show time and date (duh), AQI data from a [Purple Air](https://www2.purpleair.com/) sensor, current weather info and 4 hour forecast from [Pirate Weather](http://pirateweather.net/), count of unread email in an IMAP account's inbox, and headlines from an RSS feed, with randomly selected background images, which can be remotely switched to video from a configurable list of streams for monitoring 3D prints or keeping an eye on a doorbell camera.  (Or just displaying kittens, when the need arises)

If you come across this and want to use it or hack it into your own design, cool; the bits I've created are licensed CC BY-NC 4.0, and you can look at LICENSE.md for the licensing info on the bits I grabbed from elsewhere.  (Mostly art assets, because no one wants programmer art hanging on their wall)

If you made changes that you think should be added to my version, I'm quite happy to accept pull requests, but I do have a more-than-full-time job, so I may be slow in acting on them.
